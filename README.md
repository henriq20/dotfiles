# My Dotfiles

I'm currently using **Qtile** as my Window Manager.

## Qtile requirements

If you want to use my Qtile config, you may want to install these fonts:

- JetBrains Mono;
- Font Awesome 6 Pro Solid/Regular.

## Post Installation

Here are some things I like to do on every arch install.

- [Early KMS start](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel_mode_setting#Early_KMS_start) for AMD gpu;
- Set up [autologin](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/getty#Automatic_login_to_virtual_console) with getty;
- [Silent boot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Silent_boot) by adding `quiet` to the kernel parameters.
